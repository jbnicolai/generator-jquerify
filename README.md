## Getting Started


### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-jquerify from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jquerify
```

Initiate the generator:

```bash
yo jquerify
```

Create a new module

```bash
yo jquerify:mod modName
```
